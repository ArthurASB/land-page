# land-page
This is my second project created as part of the "The Odin Project" curriculum.

This project helps me practice the HTML and CSS knowledge I've acquired so far.
Examples of such knowledge are:
- Basic HTML Boilerplate
- HTML elements and their default CSS properties
- Altering HTML elements through CSS
- Flexbox
- Basic web page layouts

By the end of this exercise, I should be able to build a basic professional web page with different sections that showcase different flexbox layouts.
